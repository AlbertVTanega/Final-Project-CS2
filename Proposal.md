📌 Project Proposal (Draft)

📝 Project Title
Library Borrowing Record System

🔍 Problem Statement
Many school libraries still record book borrowing using paper, which makes it hard to track borrowed and returned books. This causes delays, confusion, and missing records.  
The project solves this problem by creating a digital system that stores and tracks student borrowers and the books they borrow using JSON data.  
The dataset shows a list of students, their borrower IDs, and the books they borrowed with details like title, author, borrow date, and return date.

🎯 Project Objectives
Objective 1: To analyze and summarize data from the library borrowing JSON dataset.  
Objective 2: To help librarians monitor borrowed and returned books easily.  
Objective 3: To apply JSON handling and Python programming concepts in solving real problems.

⚙️ Planned Features
Feature 1: Display all borrowers and their borrowed books. (Starter idea)  
Feature 2: Show a list of books that are not yet returned. (Starter idea)  
Feature 3: Count how many books each student borrowed. (Own idea)  
Feature 4: Display overdue books based on borrow date. (Own idea)  
Feature 5: Allow searching for a book title or student name. (Own idea)

⌨️ Planned Inputs and Outputs
Inputs:
- Borrower ID or student name  
- Book title (for searching)  
- Date range (optional for overdue checking)

Outputs:
- List of borrowed books per student  
- List of unreturned or overdue books  
- Total books borrowed per student  
- Search results for book or borrower

🧠 Logic Plan (Pseudocode)
Choose ONE way to describe your program’s logic:

Option 1: Pseudocode
Write your steps in plain English. Example:
Load JSON file Display menu of features If user chooses "1", compute average grade per student If user chooses "2", list all borrowed books Repeat until user exits program

Option 2: Flowchart
Attach or draw a flowchart showing how the program will work.
